# D2Animations
allows you to extract various d2 graphic files and save them as images/animations.

This is a pure js solution, simply drop your files into the rectangle and wait until all is parsed.
Then you can (should be able to) recolor images and animations.

<b>Note that you must provide at least a palette to see images and animations ;).</b>

# Comments
I don't know much about the use cases, have been asked to do smt. for animations. If you need additional features, feel free to ask for them.
GIF export is not yet implemented, will be in the future.

The GUI styling is really bad, I'm aware of it but I wont invest much time in fixing it probably.
If you want to make this GUI more robust and usable feel free to do so!
I'm not a web developer so be prepared..

Go to Bilian Belchev and Paul Siramy without their knowledge, because I basically just implemented what they found and documented.
